## Introduction

This JavaScript code represents a simple online bookstore application. Users can view books, add them to a cart, check out, and more. We'll explain each part of the code in detail, with a focus on how classes, switch statements, and try-catch-finally statements are utilized.

---

## Book Class

### `class Book`

- This class defines the structure of a book object.
- It has properties such as `title`, `author`, `price`, and `stockQuantity`.
- A `constructor` initializes these properties when a book object is created.

---

## Initializing Books

### `const books`

- An array of `Book` objects is initialized, representing the available books in the store.
- Each book object is created with a title, author, price, and stock quantity.

---

## Displaying Books

### `function displayBooks()`

- This function populates the webpage with book information.
- It creates HTML elements for each book and displays details like title, author, price, and stock quantity.
- Users can click a button to toggle book details visibility.
- The "Add to Cart" button allows adding books to the cart, but it checks if the book is in stock.

---

## User Actions

### `function handleUserAction(action, index)`

- This function handles user actions based on the provided action type and book index.
- Actions include viewing details, adding to the cart, checking out, clearing the cart, and toggling cart visibility.

#### Using Switch Statements

- Inside `handleUserAction`, switch statements are used to determine the action type and execute the corresponding code block.
- This approach keeps the code organized and makes it easy to add new actions in the future.

---

## Toggling Book Details

### `function toggleBookDetails(index)`

- Toggles the visibility of book details (author, price, and stock quantity) when the user clicks the "View Book Details" button.

---

## Adding Books to the Cart

### `function addToCart(index)`

- Adds a selected book to the cart if it's in stock.
- Decreases the book's stock quantity and updates the UI.
- Throws an error if the book is out of stock.

#### Using Try-Catch-Finally Statements

- Try-catch-finally statements are used to handle potential errors when adding books to the cart.
- The try block attempts to add the book to the cart, and if successful, it updates the UI.
- If an error occurs (e.g., out of stock), the catch block handles the error and displays an error message to the user.
- The finally block is used for any clean-up or final actions if needed.

---

## Displaying the Cart

### `function displayCart()`

- Displays the contents of the cart on the webpage.
- Lists the titles and prices of books in the cart.
- Calculates and displays the total price of items in the cart.

---

## Checkout Process

### `function checkout()`

- Allows the user to proceed with the checkout process.
- Clears the cart after confirming the purchase.

---

## Clearing the Cart

### `function clearCart()`

- Clears the cart and returns books to the shelves.
- Increases the stock quantity of each book in the cart.
- Updates the displayed book list and cart display.

---

## Toggling Cart Visibility

### `function toggleCart()`

- Toggles the visibility of the cart when the user clicks the "View Cart" button.
- Updates the cart button text accordingly.

---

## Adding a Book to the Store

### `function addBookToStore()`

- Prompts the user to enter details for a new book (title, author, price, stock quantity).
- Validates the input to ensure it's valid and then creates a new `Book` object.
- Adds the new book to the store's inventory (the `books` array) and updates the UI.

---

## Conclusion

This JavaScript code provides the foundation for a basic online bookstore application. It allows users to interact with books, add them to a cart, check out, and even manage the store's inventory. Understanding each part of the code is essential for maintaining and extending the functionality of the application.

For a more interactive experience, consider embedding this markdown content into an interactive markdown editor or a web platform that supports interactive documentation. This will allow users to collapse/expand sections, execute code snippets, and interact with the explanations for a richer learning experience.

Feel free to use, modify, or extend this code for your own projects.
